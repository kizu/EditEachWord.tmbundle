# Commands for inserting before or after each words in line or selection

Right now there are two commands:

1. `Option`+`Cmd`+`,` — `Insert before each word` — adds multiple tab stops before each word in line or selection, so you could insert something before words simultaneously. 
2. `Option`+`Cmd`+`.` — `Insert after each word` — do the same things, but inserts tab stops _after_ each word.
