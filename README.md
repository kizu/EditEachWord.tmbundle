# Commands for inserting before or after each words in line or selection

Right now there are two commands:

1. <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd> — `Insert before each word` — adds multiple tab stops before each word in line or selection, so you could insert something before words simultaneously. 
2. <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> — `Insert after each word` — do the same things, but inserts tab stops _after_ each word.
